# GarageDoorOpener

My attempt at turning my regular garagedoor opener smart using a RaspberryPi Pico-w.

The pico listens on for commands from a calling app on a local network acts in accordance with the command given.

- Open door
- Close door
- Get current state of door (supported if you have at least one reed magnet to keep track of state)
- Stop
- Sleep

- Keeps track of how long your door has been in a none closed state.

More documentation to come once the project has been completed.
